Remember [SyncMyPix](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nloko.android.syncmypix&hl=en)?!?

I do...vaguely. I've been putting off integrating some fine work from contributors, and I figured that **it's been long enough!**.

I've finally gotten around to merging in their work creating version **0.2**. Here's a quick summary of what's gone into this release:
	
  * Update contributors in [README](https://github.com/nloko/SyncMyPix/blob/master/README.md)
  * Remove read log permission
  * Default to high quality photo setting and remove setting
  * Fix problem with photos not getting cached to SD card
  * Improve Greek name matching ([thanks Diomidis Spinellis](https://github.com/nloko/SyncMyPix/commit/3dc398db80e7aea938c9c604f6f7af5a14c577f7))
  * Fix name matching when names contain Turkish characters ([thanks Deadknight](https://github.com/nloko/SyncMyPix/commit/4c8a0084c6388da52ccbcd71216a12b15e1a30c5))
  * ICS fixes (crop view, etc.)
  * Use Facebook Connect SDK instead of homegrown API library
  * **_Attempt_** to get highest resolution photos possible from Facebook

Those last 3 are also [thanks to Deadknight](https://github.com/nloko/SyncMyPix/commit/151a96098b43f2e19216ceb6d88ea2e407a383b0).

Unfortunately, I haven't had any time to work on SyncMyPix, hence the delay with getting out a release with all these improvements. I've been quite busy with work and other projects. So busy, in fact, that I'm calling this my last release of SyncMyPix. I haven't tested this enough to feel comfortable releasing it through the market (_I actually did publish it, but later removed it_). But, I didn't want that to stop me from sharing this, so the [downloads](https://github.com/nloko/SyncMyPix/downloads) are available from Github. I'm going to be **removing SyncMyPix from the store a week from today**.

I'm glad it's been useful to a lot of people, but I've got to move on to other things. I'll continue to host the source code on [Github](https://github.com/nloko/SyncMyPix), as I'd love to see someone take the app and improve on it, as it seems there are still people that are interested. So, please, feel free to [fork](https://github.com/nloko/SyncMyPix/fork) it and make it your own!
