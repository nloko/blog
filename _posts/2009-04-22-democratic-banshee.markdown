While discussing my SoC project with a friend, I learned of a new feature in iTunes 8.1 called [DJ](http://www.macworld.com/article/139330/2009/03/itunes.html). Basically, this lets any iPhone users that can get on your network vote for the next N songs to play. So, I thought..hmmm...perhaps this is something that could be integrated into Banshee after I get the Telepathy extension done?   
  
I envision a group of IM users subscribed to stream a single user's library maybe using [UPnP AV](http://mail.gnome.org/archives/banshee-list/2009-March/msg00217.html) or something. Then, the users can vote on the next N songs that will be played. Perhaps the play queue could be used to store the next N songs. In my opinion, that would be pretty cool.
