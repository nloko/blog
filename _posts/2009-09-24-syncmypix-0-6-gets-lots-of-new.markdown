Since my last blog post about [SyncMyPix](http://code.google.com/p/syncmypix/), it's seen quite a few changes. Some of these changes landed in 0.5, but I'm only getting around to blogging about things now. Special thanks again to [Inkscape](http://www.inkscape.org/) for providing the needed tools for creating the background graphic. I think Inkscape is an awesome, easy-to-use product.

I am enjoying tinkering around with my little experimental [Android](http://www.android.com/) project. What started out as an experiment has turned into something that I'm finding very useful. Anyway, I'm not going to blabber on too much about what's new, since the below pictures are quite self explanatory.
