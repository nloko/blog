Just a short midweek progress [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0mGKXN_znk)



Shows progress on visual indication of download status per file and auto importing of downloaded files. And, for the aggregators, here's a screenshot.

Thought I'd throw something up real quick, as it's much better than the previous demo. The changes may be subtle, but it's funny how sometimes small things make a huge difference. As always, comments, suggestions, nitpicks...all welcome. That's all for now. Enjoy.
