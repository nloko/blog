Inspired by the flurry of [I built x apps this year](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6985700) posts over the holidays, I decided I would make **1** app in **1** weekend. I took an idea and ran with it. Pushing myself to get it done in 2 days forced me to keep it focused and cut out unnecessay things.

I'd like you introduce you to the result of my weekend hackathon, [**Hue**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ca.nloko.hue).

-> ![Hue Your Color Expert. Browse endless colors. Create beautiful schemes and palettes](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/6578423/hue_feature.png "Hue: Your Color Expert") <-

<img width="200" src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/6578423/hue_colors.png" style="margin:10px;float:left;"/>**Hue** is an Android app based on a simple premise: it should be easy to browse a large variety of colors and view a large variety of colors that are very likely to go well with a certain color.

**Hue** gives you you get an endless stream of colors to choose from. Want more colors? just keep scrolling.

Tapping a color presents you with a another stream of different color schemes created algorithmically based on rules of color theory.

Viewing schemes also lets you tap colors to learn about their [HEX code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors), [RGB](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model) & [HSV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV) values, and even sample tints, shades, and complement colors.

Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Thus, **Hue** tries to present you with a wide selection of schemes combining tints, shades, complements, analogous, and neutral colors.

**Hue** does a great job. Regardless, nobody is perfect. So, there's a solution for this problem too. Tapping the *Share* button at the bottom of the *schemes* view lets you export an HTML page containing all the schemes created for your chosen color. If you're a designer, developer, or just a tech savvy kind of person, this is great because you can [use your browser](https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/) to further tweak and experiment with colors.

**Hue** is great for brainstorming color schemes whether you're painting, redecorating, designing a website, or even planning your wardrobe. It's available in the Google Play store for [only $0.99](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ca.nloko.hue).
