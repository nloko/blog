The good news is, I just pushed a new version of SyncMyPix to the market. And, if you're turkish or polish, you may notice improved name matching thanks to [some work from a new contributor](https://github.com/nloko/SyncMyPix/pull/4). The bad news is, unless you're turkish or polish, there's nothing to get excited about. To be honest, more came out of this release than went in.

Here's the summary of changes:
	
* Minimum supported SDK is level 8 (Froyo)
* Removed _Send Log _option

I'm bumping the OS requirement up to workaround an Android [SSL bug](http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=17680). It's quite sad that it has come to this as a solution. But, I just don't have the energy or motivation to code up a fix that, in my opinion, would be a sloppy workaround for an OS bug. And, I've removed the _Send Log _option because its more than served its purpose.

I know some users might be upset about my so called _solution_, so I've provided an [app build on code.google.com](http://syncmypix.googlecode.com/files/SyncMyPix.apk) that provides legacy support. That is, the legacy build runs on Android 1.5 and up.

I'm quite happy that users have found SyncMyPix so useful. It's been a lot of fun developing it. Unfortunately, this will probably be the last bit of work I put into it for awhile. However, the [source is available](https://github.com/nloko/SyncMyPix) on github. And, pull requests are always welcome.
