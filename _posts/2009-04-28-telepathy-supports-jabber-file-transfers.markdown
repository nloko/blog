[Sweeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet!](http://cass.no-ip.com/~cassidy/blog/index.php/post/2009/04/03/Jabber-file-transfer-support-in-Telepathy) :)  
  
If support for this wasn't available, I probably would have had to use HTTP over a Telepathy [stream tube](http://telepathy.freedesktop.org/spec.html#org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Channel.Type.StreamTube.DRAFT) to provide downloading capabilities in my [Banshee SoC project](http://socghop.appspot.com/student_project/show/google/gsoc2009/gnome/t124022403765). A [file transfer channel](http://telepathy.freedesktop.org/spec.html#org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Channel.Type.FileTransfer) should be much easier. :)  
  
Yes, I'm a little over excited. But, I've been studying for finals, so it doesn't take too much to excite me right now.
