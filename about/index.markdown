# Other Projects

I've been known to [contribute](http://git.gnome.org/browse/banshee/log/?qt=author&q=Loknath) to [Banshee](http://banshee-project.org/) from [time](http://banshee-project.org/download/archives/1-5-3/) to [time](http://mail.gnome.org/archives/commits-list/2009-November/msg01586.htm). When I do things worth sharing, I usually share them through [Github](http://github.com/nloko).
